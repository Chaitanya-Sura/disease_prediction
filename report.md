## Discussion
### Similarities
- All models are supervised classifiers.
- Require labeled data and similar preprocessing steps.

### Differences
- **Logistic Regression:** Linear, interpretable, may underperform on complex data.
- **Decision Tree:** Captures non-linearities, prone to overfitting.
- **Random Forest:** Ensemble, reduces overfitting, robust.
- **SVM:** Good for high-dimensional data, sensitive to scaling, can be slow on large datasets.
